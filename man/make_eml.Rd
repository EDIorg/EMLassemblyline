\arguments{
\item{path}{(character) Path to where the template(s) will be imported.}

\item{data.path}{(character) Path to where the data files are stored.}

\item{eml.path}{(character) Path to where the EML will be writtn.}

\item{dataset.title}{(character) Dataset title. Be descriptive (more than 5 words) and 
consider including the temporal coverage (e.g. "GLEON: Long term lake 
chloride concentrations from North America and Europe: 1940-2016").}

\item{data.files}{(character) Data file name(s). If more than one, then supply as a 
vector of character strings (e.g. 
`data.files = c("concentrations.csv", "characteristics.csv")`).}

\item{data.files.description}{(character) Data file description(s). Brief description of `data.files`.
If more than one, then supply as a vector of character strings in the 
same order as listed in `data.files`.}

\item{data.files.quote.character}{(character) Quote character(s) used in `data.files`. If more than one, 
then supply as a vector of character strings in the same order as 
listed in `data.files`. This argument is required only if your data 
contain quotations. If the quote character is a quotation, then enter 
`"\\""`. If the quote character is an apostrophe, then enter `"\\'"`.}

\item{data.files.url}{(character) The URL of where your data tables can be downloaded by a
data repository. This argument is not required, if the data will be 
manually uploaded to a data repository.}

\item{zip.dir}{(character) The name of .zip file(s). If more than one, then supply as a
vector of character strings. The .zip file(s) must be located at 
`data.path`.}

\item{zip.dir.description}{(character) The description(s) of `zip.dir`. If more than one, then 
supply as a vector of character strings in the same order as listed in 
`zip.dir`.}

\item{temporal.coverage}{(character) Beginning and ending dates of the dataset as a vector of 
character strings in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.}

\item{geographic.description}{(character) Geographic description. Don't use this argument if geographic
coordinates in the `bounding_boxes.txt` template.}

\item{geographic.coordinates}{(character) Geographic coordinates delineating the bounding area or 
point of a dataset, in decimal degrees. This argument is not required 
if using `bounding_boxes.txt`. Values must be listed in this order:
North, East, South, West. Longitudes West of the 
prime meridian and latitudes South of the equator are negative. If 
representing a point, repeat the latitude for North and South, and 
repeat the longitude for East and West (e.g. 
`geographic.coordinates = c('28.38', '-119.95', '28.38', '-119.95)`).}

\item{maintenance.description}{(character) Indicator of whether data collection is `ongoing` or 
`completed`.}

\item{user.id}{(character) ID(s) of data repository user account(s). If more than one,
supply as a vector of character strings. Contact EDI 
(info@environmentaldatainitiative.org) to obtain one. This argument is
not required.}

\item{affiliation}{(character) Affiliations of the `user.id`(s). Valid options for EDI are
`LTER` and `EDI`. If more than one, supply as a vector of character 
strings in the same order as corresponding `user.id`(s). This argument
is not required.}

\item{environment}{(character) EDI Data Repository environment in which data provenance is
being derived from. Can be: `development`, `staging`, `production`. 
This argument is not required.}

\item{package.id}{(character) EDI Data Repository Data package ID for this dataset. A 
missing package ID defaults to `edi.101.1`.}

\item{provenance}{(character) EDI Data Repository Data package ID(s) corresponding to 
parent datasets from which this dataset was created (e.g. 
`knb-lter-cap.46.3`).}

\item{return.obj}{(logical) Return the EML as an R object of class `EML object`.}

\item{write.file}{(logical) Write file to `path`. Defaults to TRUE.}

\itemize{
        \item{`Status messages` describing the EML creation status}
        \item{`Validation result` indicating whether the EML is schema valid}

}
\description{
Render the content of metadata templates into the EML, then validate the
    EML and write to file.
}
\details{
If validation fails, open the EML document in a .xml editor to identify 
    the source of error. Often the error is small and quickly resolved with 
    the aid of an editors schema validator. If the issue can't be resolved
    then forward the `EML` to info@environmentaldatainitiative.org for 
    support.
