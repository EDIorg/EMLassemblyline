}
\description{
Import template(s) for defining categorical variable codes used in data
    tables. This function automatically extracts and returns categorical 
    codes, the definitions of which must be supplied by a human. 
    Instructions for filling out the template are at
    \url{https://clnsmth.github.io/EMLassemblyline/articles/instructions.html}.
}
\details{
`define_catvars` knows which variables are `categorical` based on their 
    listing under the `class` column in the `attributes_*.txt` file(s). 
    
    Existing template(s) will not be overwritten by subsequent calls to 
    `define_catvars`.
