## Basic use case

Creating and maintaining EML for a dataset consists of five steps:

1. [Organize data package](https://ediorg.github.io/EMLassemblyline/articles/organize_data_package.html) contents into a directory structure readable by EAL and according with user preferences.
2. [Template metadata](https://ediorg.github.io/EMLassemblyline/articles/create_tmplts.html) using functions to automatically extract info from the data.
3. [Edit templates](https://ediorg.github.io/EMLassemblyline/articles/edit_tmplts.html) with text and spreadsheet editors to supply info that could not be inferred.
4. [Make EML](https://ediorg.github.io/EMLassemblyline/articles/create_eml.html) metadata from template content.
5. [Publish data package](https://ediorg.github.io/EMLassemblyline/articles/publish_data_package.html) in a data repository.

Revise EML by simply editing templates and rerunning `make_eml()`.

## Advanced use cases

Advanced use cases include:

-  [Automate data publication](https://ediorg.github.io/EMLassemblyline/articles/auto_pub.html) for ongoing time series or data derived from ongoing time series.
-  [Use EAL via exchange format](https://ediorg.github.io/EMLassemblyline/articles/exchange_format.html) to create EML from any metadata storage/organization system.
