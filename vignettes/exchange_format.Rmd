## The exchange format

The Environmental Data Initiative is in the beginning stages of developing an exchange format for environmental metadata to facilitate use of EMLassemblyline (and other metadata builders) with any metadata storage/organization system (e.g. [LTER-core-metabase](https://github.com/lter/LTER-core-metabase)).

Stay tuned!
