In 2014 and 2015, we quantified decomposition of plant litter material collected from each plot.  In late May, we collected vascular plant litter from the surface of each plot, along with <emphasis>Sphagnum</emphasis> peat (<emphasis>S. fuscum</emphasis>-derived), from roughly 5-15 cm below the capitula.  We placed nylon mesh litter bags with mixed vascular plant litter (approx. 1.7 g dry mass; roughly equal masses of <emphasis>Rhododendron groenlandicum</emphasis>, <emphasis>Andromeda polifolia</emphasis>, <emphasis>Chamaedaphne calyculata</emphasis>, <emphasis>Smilacina trifolia</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Rubus chamaemorus</emphasis>) or peat approximately 10 cm below the peat surface in early June (in 2014, 3 bags per plot of vascular litter and 3 bags of <emphasis>Sphagnum</emphasis> peat; in 2015, 4 bags of each material).  Upon retrieval in October of each year, we manually removed debris from each retrieved bag before drying at 55 C for a minimum of 5 days, and weighing.
